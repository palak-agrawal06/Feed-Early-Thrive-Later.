Timely introduction of solid and semi-solid foods during the critical 6–8 month window is a powerful intervention with lasting impacts on child survival, health, and development. This report presents a visual and data-driven exploration of global complementary feeding coverage and its association with adolescent population trends.
Findings show that while some countries — especially in Latin America and Eastern Europe — have surpassed UNICEF’s 80% target, others continue to lag, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. There is also a noticeable inverse relationship between higher infant feeding rates and the size of adolescent cohorts, suggesting potential long-term demographic benefits.
Despite modest global gains since 2000, progress has been uneven and slow. The insights in this report emphasize the need for renewed commitment, behaviour-change interventions, and inclusive food policies to ensure every child receives timely nutrition and a stronger start in life.
